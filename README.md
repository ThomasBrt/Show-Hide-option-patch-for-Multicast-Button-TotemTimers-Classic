<h2 style="color:#0070DD">Why this patch ?</h2>

Like many other shamans on Azeroth, I much prefer TotemTimers to the default totem bar. But if you also think that the Multicast Button (with Call of the Elements, etc...) is often not needed... Indeed, once you've bind one totem set, you can change your pre-selected totems by Right-Click, so you may want to disable the Multicast Button ! However, this option causes <b>a switch to the default totem bar (as written on their CurseForge page), and you're not able to pre-select totems anymore.</b> This patch is a try to do it right, <b>giving you finally a way to show/hide this button while retaining all the good features of TotemTimers</b>.

<h2 style="color:#0070DD">Features</h2>

* <b>The Multicast Button option from TotemTimers, becomes a Show/Hide option for this button (without switching to the default totem bar)</b> (go in TotemTimers options panel > Timers tab).
* Two commands to switch the display mode more quickly : <b>"/tt mc on" and "/tt mc off"</b>, when needed between fights.
* No UI reload required

<h2 style="color:#0070DD">How to install</h2>

To install the patch, all you need is to replace your files in TotemTimers addon folder (and TotemTimers/GUI folder) by the following ones. 

 <h3 style="color:cyan">Github link here : https://github.com/ThomasBrt/Show_Hide_option_patch_for_Multicast_Button_TotemTimers_Classic</h3>

<b>It contains 5 updated lua files :  MultiSpell.lua, Timers.lua, Settings.lua, DefaultSettings.lua, TotemTimers.lua and GUI folder.</b>

In case of improper manipulation, don't forget you can always redownload the addon from Curseforge (I will try to upload future versions of the patch if needed).
