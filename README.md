<h2 style="color:#0070DD">Why this patch ?</h2>

Like many other shamans on Azeroth, I much prefer TotemTimers to the default totem bar. <b>But the Multicast Button (with Call of the Elements, etc...) is often not needed...</b> Indeed, once you've bind one totem set, you can change your pre-selected totems in it by Right-Click. So you may want to disable the Multicast Button ! However, the default option causes <b>a switch to the default totem bar (as written on their CurseForge page), and you're not able to pre-select totems anymore.</b> This patch is a try to do it right, <b>giving you finally a way to show/hide this button while retaining all the good features of TotemTimers</b>.

<h2 style="color:#0070DD">Features</h2>

* <b>The "Multicast Button" option from TotemTimers, becomes a Show/Hide option for this button (without switching to the default totem bar)</b> (go in TotemTimers options panel > Timers tab).
* Two commands to switch the display mode more quickly : <b>"/tt mc on" and "/tt mc off"</b>, when needed between fights.
* No UI reload required

<h2 style="color:#0070DD">How to install</h2>

To install the patch, all you need is to replace your files in TotemTimers addon folder (and TotemTimers/GUI folder) by the following ones. 

 <h3 style="color:cyan">Github link here : https://github.com/ThomasBrt/Show_Hide_option_patch_for_Multicast_Button_TotemTimers_Classic</h3>

<b>It contains 5 updated lua files :  MultiSpell.lua, Timers.lua, Settings.lua, DefaultSettings.lua, TotemTimers.lua and GUI folder.</b>

In case of improper manipulation, don't forget you can always redownload the addon from Curseforge (I will try to upload future versions of the patch if needed).
